# Food Delivery Service Analysis :motor_scooter:

Internal examination by assessing seven key performance indicators, and conducted an analysis of its competitors, by which I created an accurate roadmap for growth optimization.

The (fictitious) company is successfully growing but because of the newly opened delivery companies in the city Graz, the competition in the field is becoming huge. The strategy team has requested a competitor analysis which would help to create an accurate roadmap for growth optimization.
